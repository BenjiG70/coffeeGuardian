# coffeeGuardian

### For who is the repo?

this repo is for all those small and mid-sized companys/departments with an old coffee-list which is used to track the coffee-consume. With parts which are cheap and easy to buy, you have the possibility to erase all the paper lists and set one central system for your department/company. 

As I sayed, this repository is for small and mid-sized companys and departments but itÂ´s possible to use this software in big companys/departments too. Only the process could be a bit messy.

I hope you have fun to build this system and leave a star :D
Best wishes from Germany.

Friendly Reminder: This repo is in the first status, the project is still in the development phase. If Version 1.0 is released the wiring is final and the development is just for the software.
